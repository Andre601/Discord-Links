And Pull requests to add or update listed Discord Server are welcome, but please keep the following things in mind.

# Styling
When adding a new server to the list, will you need to follow a specific Styling to make it look good.

The syntax is as follows:  
```markdown
----
#### <badge?> <Discord name>
<description>

**Invite**:  
https://discord.gg/<code>
```

## `<badge?>`
When the Discord is either verified or partnered will you need to prefix the name with either `:discord-verified:` or `:discord-partner:`

The Header would then look something like this:

### Verified
```markdown
#### :discord-verified: Verified Discord
```

### Partnered
```markdown
#### :discord-partner: Partnered Discord
```

### Normal
```markdown
#### Normal Discord
```

## `<Discord name>`
This is the name that the Server has.  
When the name contains speciak characters will you need to remove them. This also includes Emojis.  
If a character is used as a separator in the name, can you use a `-` as replacement.

### `<description>`
A small description of the Discord. This should preferably not be longer than 1 sentence.  
If the Discord has a set tagline (i.e. is part of a Website with a tagline) use the tagline instead.

### `<code>`
The invite code used.  
This **must** be a discord.gg Invite! If the Discord is partnered/verified, or has Boost level 3, try to use the vanity url they might have.
